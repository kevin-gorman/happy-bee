#### HAPPY BEE!

This was my first attempt at AI with this fun, simple project. It's the same as flappy bird except with a happy bee. As a bee enthusiast, I want to make my bee population as fit as possible, and a NEAT based AI approach can accomplish this.

You can play it yourself using your space bar, train a new population to learn to navigate the obsticals, or watch the best genome from your training trials.
